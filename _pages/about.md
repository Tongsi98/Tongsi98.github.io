I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Math and Statistics](https://mathstat.slu.edu/), as well as a Master student in Artificial Intelligence in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.slu.edu/science-and-engineering/academics/computer-science/index.php)  at [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu/). Before came to SLU, I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and minor in Actrial Science at Jilin University in China

My joint background leads to my wide range of research interests, including <b>Missing value inputation, Change-point detection, Anomaly detection, Time-series analysis, Statistical modeling and Machine Learning </b>. I'm also interested in other topics, like predictive modeling, network analysis and probabilistic graph models.

You can find my CV here:[CV](Tongsi98.github.io/files/tongCV.pdf)
 
I love both cats and dogs, and my cat exhibits such a dog-like personality that I've named him Doggie!
